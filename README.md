### Abstract
This article portrays the relationship between fractional order differential calculus and the computational intelligence method, applying it to the improvement of intelligent systems. The Kirchhoff Laws, represented by second order differential equations, were solved via non-integer order differential calculus. The results obtained were used in the implementation of decision trees, which allowed the decision rules to be incorporated into the controllers. The results obtained by mathematical modeling did magnify the information extracted from Kirchhoff's Laws. Due to the gain magnitude of this information, the decision trees were obtained with greater precision and accuracy. In this way, it was achieved to build a hybrid system capable of being used in the development of controllers automata that has the lower response time and highest efficiency.
